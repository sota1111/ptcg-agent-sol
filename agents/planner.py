"""Determinized MCTS planner (SOT-1795, from ptcg-agent-matsu SOT-1672).

Built on the engine's determinization search API (cg/api.py:517-639). Each
decision:

1. samples `n_worlds` determinizations — assignments of the hidden zones
   (own deck order / facedown prizes, opponent hand / deck / prizes /
   facedown Active) consistent with all visible information (discards,
   boards, face-up prizes, stadium ownership are subtracted from the
   candidate pool);
2. runs PUCT-guided tree search in each world THROUGH the engine (the
   engine's search API remains the single source of truth for legality and
   state transitions — this module never simulates rules itself);
3. aggregates root-action statistics across worlds and returns the action
   with the most total visits, deviating from the greedy prior only past
   `deviate_margin` (the SOT-1672 decisive parameter, champion 0.1).

Chance events (coin flips) are made explicit with
`search_begin(manual_coin=True)` and sampled 50/50 from the injected agent
Rng, never left to the engine's internal non-injectable RNG. The engine
keeps its own RNG for shuffle effects, so the same-seed reproducibility
guarantee is scoped to AGENT-side randomness (tests pin it against a
deterministic backend double).

Anytime contract: the search consumes at most `budget * budget_fraction`
(default 80%) and can be cut off at ANY point — before the first iteration
completes the best-so-far action is the greedy prior (root candidates are
ordered by GreedyAgent scores), so a legal, sensible action is always
returned.

fable deltas vs the matsu champion planner (SOT-1795):
- In-tree/rollout selection counts come from the 竹式 per-context table
  (`agents.rule_policy.preferred_count`, all 49 contexts explicit) instead
  of matsu's crude "any known context -> max"; the table also applies the
  actor's deck-reserve draw guard inside the tree.
- The mctsS TurnSolver (SOT-1677) and value-net Early Cutoff (SOT-1679) are
  NOT ported — neither beat the matsu champion in its confirm gates.
- The root deck guard (`deck_guard_threshold`, SOT-1704/1729) is ported but
  defaults OFF: matsu's screens rejected it (0.44/0.40 vs champion). The
  standing self-deck-out steer is the evaluator's `deck_low` gradient plus
  the rule-policy draw guard.

All randomness flows through the per-decision `Rng` stream passed to
`plan()`; this module never touches global `random`.
