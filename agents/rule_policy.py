"""竹式 rule policy (SOT-1795) — explicit per-context decisions, no random holes.

ptcg-agent-take's SOT-1682/1694 lesson: the biggest cheap win over a generic
scorer is an explicit SelectContext dispatch that covers EVERY context the
engine can ask about, so nothing ever falls through to a random-legal pick.
This module encodes that as data + a thin policy class over fable's View:

- `COUNT_MODE` maps ALL 49 shipped SelectContext values (cg/api.py:68-118) to
  an explicit how-many rule ("min" / "max" / deck-guarded variants). Unknown
  future contexts (the competition may append enum values) default to "min" —
  commit to as little as allowed, never crash.
- `RulePolicy.choose(view)` ranks options with GreedyAgent's card-attribute
  scoring, applies per-context ordering overrides (setup Active is HP-first,
  promotion is readiness-first — SOT-1682), and picks the context's count.
- The self-deck-out guard (SOT-1697: deck-out dominated matsu's losses) lives
  here for the policy layer: draw/search selections (DRAW_COUNT, TO_HAND)
  flip from "max" to "min" once the own deck is at or below `deck_reserve`.
  The MCTS layer gets the same steer from the evaluator's `deck_low`
  gradient; this table also drives the planner's in-tree candidate counts.

`RuleAgent` wraps the policy as layer 3 of the submission fallback chain
(MCTS -> Greedy -> Rule -> random-legal; main.py).
