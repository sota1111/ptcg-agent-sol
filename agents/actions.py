"""Action Enumerator (SOT-1671) — layer [2] of the 4-layer architecture.

The engine's legal-move API (`obs.select`) is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH:
an action is a list of indices into `select.option` with
`minCount <= len <= maxCount` and no duplicates (main.py:22-30,
docs/engine-facts.md §1.1). This module never invents moves — it only
enumerates, masks, validates and samples what the engine offers.
