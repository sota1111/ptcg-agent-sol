"""Agent base class (SOT-1671).

`act(obs_dict)` implements the submission contract (main.py:22-36):
- initial call with `select == None` -> return the 60-card deck;
- otherwise -> a legal list of option indices.

Subclasses implement `choose(view) -> list[int]`. Whatever happens inside
`choose` (unknown enum values, unknown cards, scoring bugs), `act` degrades
to a uniformly random LEGAL action instead of crashing or submitting an
illegal move; such degradations are counted in `fallback_count` so benches
and tests can assert they stay at zero on the known card pool.
