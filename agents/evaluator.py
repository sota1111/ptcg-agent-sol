"""Leaf evaluator (SOT-1795, from ptcg-agent-matsu SOT-1672) — layer [4].

`Evaluator.evaluate(obs, root_player)` maps a battle observation to an
estimated win probability in [0, 1] for `root_player`. The planner
(agents/planner.py) calls it on non-terminal rollout leaves.

Observations are duck-typed: any object shaped like `cg.api.Observation`
(the engine's search states) works, as do test doubles built from
SimpleNamespace. Every feature derives from state/card ATTRIBUTES visible in
the observation (prizes, HP, energy counts, hand/deck sizes) — per-card
weight tables keyed by card ID/name are forbidden.

Learned value functions (matsu's SOT-1674/1679 LearnedEvaluator) are
deliberately NOT ported: SOT-1795 ships no learned components (the matsu
value-net candidate never beat the heuristic champion; screen-gated followers
can add one later). The `deck_low` gradient below is fable's standing
self-deck-out guard (SOT-1697 loss analysis: deck-out dominated matsu's
losses — 53% vs 竹, 91% vs 梅).
